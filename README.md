# 93-bot
The bot that was a huge mistake

This bot used was used for the trollbox (Windows 93)

Ofc, it was by me that created the bot. (Not Lw82) And most of the comments here is fucking cringe af.

Plus, this bot has too many useless commands, and i regret adding them.

# Why did you stop supporting it?
1. People hated it
2. Code is messy
3. Browser Bot (ew)
4. Too many fucking old versions of the bot. Made it really hard to find the latest one.
5. Trollbox is toxic.
6. Lw82 ruined it.
7. And many more reasons.

# Lw82 bots is better!
Yeah yeah yeah, i get it. you like his better then mine. (Fucking idiots..)

# Please bring it back!
No.

# PLEEEEEASE
NO.

# PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE??
I SAID NO.

# How do i set up?
1. First off, you need to go to www.windows93.net/trollbox (Be sure to enter a nick name!)
2. Right click anywhere
3. Click on "Inspect Element"
4. Goto the tab that should say "console"
5. Open the txt file.
6. then Select all on the txt file
7. Copy it.
8. Paste it in the console.
9. Hit enter.
10. Then you're done.

# Can I use this?
Yes, You are free to take any code, since that i don't care if anyone uses it. Feel free to fork it. Do what ever the fuck you want.

# Is this the latest version of 93!Bot?
Honestly, i am not sure. Since my file system is unorginized. This Silverplate.txt file is from Dragsun, from discord. Maybe when i find it, i will be sure to update y'all.

Since i've formatted my pc, i will not be adding new versions in this code (unless if i do find any)
