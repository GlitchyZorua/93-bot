# 93-bot
The bot that was a huge mistake

This bot used was used for the trollbox (Windows 93)

Ofc, it was by me that created the bot. (Not Lw82) And most of the comments here is fucking cringe af.

Plus, this bot has too many useless commands, and i regret adding them.

# Why did you stop supporting it?
1. People hated it
2. Code is messy
3. Browser Bot (ew)
4. Too many old versions of the bot. Made it really hard to find the latest one.
5. Trollbox is toxic.
6. Lw82 ruined it.
7. And many more reasons.

# Lw82 bots is better!
Yeah yeah yeah, i get it. you like his better then mine.

# Please bring it back!
No.

# How do i set up?
1. First off, you need to go to www.windows93.net/trollbox (Be sure to enter a nickname!)
2. Right click anywhere
3. Click on "Inspect Element"
4. Goto the tab that should say "console"
5. Open the js file.
6. then Select all on the js file
7. Copy it.
8. Paste it in the console.
9. Hit enter.
10. Then you're done.

# Can I use this?
Yes, You are free to take any code under MIT License.

# Is this the latest version of 93!Bot?
Honestly, i am not sure. Since my file system is unorginized. This Silverplate.js file is from Dragsun, from discord. Maybe when i find it, i will be sure to update y'all.

Since i've formatted my pc, i will not be adding new versions in this code (unless if i do find any)

# RPG 93Bot is left unfinshed. and will never be fished
The RPG commands won't be finished, as the bot is now discontinued.

If you have ANY questions, please DM Jacobw#8117 on discord.
